# Processing Interactive Playlist Animation - LEADUWARDEN Prototype Guide

## Quick Overview
This is my tutorial that integrates my lovable app prototype, and builds on the mood tracking playlist feature using java Processing sketch that simulates the LEADUWARDEN app's music visualization system. It displays animated dots pulsing to location-matched playlist beats, shows mood-based backgrounds for different exploration modes (Peaceful, Lively, Social, Scenic), and allows users to interact with the mindful discovery experience.

## Prerequisites Checklist
- [ ] Processing IDE installed (download from processing.org)
- [ ] Understanding of LEADUWARDEN app concept

## CODE BREAKDOWN

### Step 3: Run and Test LEADUWARDEN Features (30 seconds)

1. **Click the Play button** to start the mindful exploration visualization
2. **Test mode switching**: Press 'M' to toggle between University and Spare Time modes
3. **Test mood filters**: Press numbers 1-5 to change location mood and playlist
4. **Test playlist controls**: Click to pause/resume the "music"
5. **Test spot interaction**: Hover over spots to see them pulse faster
6. **Test exploration**: Press 'R' to discover new locations

**Checkpoint 3**: Animation shows LEADUWARDEN-style interface with mode switching and mindful interactions.

## LEADUWARDEN-Specific Features Explained

### Dual Mode System:
```java
String appMode = "University";  // or "SpareTime"
// Press 'M' to toggle between campus and city exploration
```
- **University Mode**: Campus-focused with study spots, libraries, courtyards
- **Spare Time Mode**: City exploration with parks, scenic routes, discovery points

### Location-Based Mood Filters:
```java
case "peaceful": playlistName = "Quiet Study Sessions"; break;
case "lively": playlistName = "Campus Energy Mix"; break;
case "social": playlistName = "Social Hangout Beats"; break;
```
- Each mood filter changes both the visual theme and simulated playlist
- Matches LEADUWARDEN's core filtering system (Peaceful, Lively, Social, Scenic, Greenery)

### Mindful Reflection Prompts:
```java
String getReflectionPrompt() {
  switch(currentMood) {
    case "peaceful": return "What brings you calm in this moment?";
    case "scenic": return "What details catch your eye?";
  }
}
```
- Displays context-appropriate reflection questions
- Encourages mindful observation like the real LEADUWARDEN app

### Discovery Spot Visualization:
```java
String[] spotTypes = {"üå≥", "üíß", "üèõÔ∏è", "‚òï", "üìö", "üå∏"};
```
- Different icons represent various location types
- Spots pulse at different intensities based on their "activity level"
- Simulates the color-coded minimalist icons from LEADUWARDEN

## Customization for LEADUWARDEN Context

### Add New Location Types:
```java
String[] spotTypes = {"üå≥", "üíß", "üèõÔ∏è", "‚òï", "üìö", "üå∏", "üèÉ", "üé®", "üçÉ"};
// Add gym, art spaces, meditation spots
```

### Create Custom Playlists:
```java
case "6":
  currentMood = "budget-friendly";
  playlistName = "Free Campus Events";
  println("üí∞ Filter: Budget-friendly activities");
  break;
```

### Add Break Suggestions:
```java
void drawBreakSuggestion() {
  if (currentMood.equals("peaceful") && appMode.equals("University")) {
    text("üí° Break Idea: 15 min ‚Üí sit at Library Bench", width/2, 100);
  }
}
```
